// Every month in Bucharest new restaurants and coffee shops open
// Starting from the examples discussed during the lab, write a program that uses callbacks and simulates asynchronous behavior
// to retrieve information about them

// the 'getPlacesNames' function will return the places array in an asynchronous manner

// we will consider later that within the 'getPlacesTypes' function it's determined
// whether the place is a coffee shop or a restaurant respecting the rule:
// if the length of the place's name is even, then it is a coffee shop
// a field named isCoffeeShop (boolean value) will be added for each place accordingly

// the 'printPlacesInfo' function will write to the console the name of the establishment and whether it is a coffee shop or not
